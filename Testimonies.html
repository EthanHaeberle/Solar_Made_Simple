            <p><b> Feedback from local Lafayette Resident:</b> <br>
            <p> Home address : 4543 Duckhorn In Lafayette, IN

            </p>
                Q: If you do not currently have Solar panels installed on your home what has stopped you?
                <br><br>
                A: "I would need a lot more information. I’d also need to understand how it’s cost effective over the long term. Am I going to save money that would compensate me over time for the investment in the solar panels, etc."
                <br><br>
                Q: If you do not currently have Solar panels installed on your home what has stopped you?
                <br><br>
                A: "Not really. We’ll have to replace our roof in the next 5-10 years probably, so that would be a good time, but I’m not sure they actually work. I guess I’m largely uninformed."
                <br><br>
                Q: If your neighbors or HOA recommended getting panels installed would you be more likely to have them installed?
                <br><br>
                A: "Not really. Peer pressure doesn’t work on me for things like this."
                <br><br>
                Q: What could make your life easier when it comes to getting solar panels installed or beginning the process of getting them installed?
                <br><br>
                A: "I would need a lot more information. I’d also need to understand how it’s cost effective over the long term. Am I going to save money that would compensate me over time for the investment in the solar panels, etc. If something breaks is there a service that can repair them. Etc. Are there voltage issues? Do you use the electrical grid as a back up on cloudy days, etc. I know enough to have a lot of questions, but not nearly enough to have answers. But I also don’t have the interest to dig deeper. Though I am learning about Elon Musk’s efforts through listening to his bio. That’s not exactly encouraging though."
